<h3><strong>Beware of Impersonation Scams</strong></h3>
<p><strong>19 June 2025</strong>
</p>
<p>Government officials will NEVER do these things over a phone call:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Ask you to transfer money;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ask you to disclose bank log-in details;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ask you to install mobile apps from unofficial app stores;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transfer your call to Police.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you receive an SMS from the government, make sure it is sent from the
<a href="http://gov.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">gov.sg</a>SMS Sender ID*.</p>
<p>Scammers may cite your personal information (e.g. name or NRIC number)
to appear legitimate. Do not automatically trust someone just because he/she
has your personal information.</p>
<p>Call the 24/7 ScamShield Helpline at 1799 to check if you are unsure if
something is a scam.</p>
<p>*Exceptions apply for National Service call-ups and emergency services.
