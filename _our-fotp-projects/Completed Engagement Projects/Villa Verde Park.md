*Artist's impression of Villa Verde Park*

An extension of Villa Verde Park will be developed across the canal from the existing green space. Intersecting with both Pang Sua Park Connector and the future Rail Corridor, the expanded Villa Verde Park offers yet another recreational green option to the estateâ€™s residents, and potential as a space to bring the Villa Verde community together. The additional park space abuts the upcoming Rail Corridor, and will also function as an activity node for Rail Corridor users.
