Telok Ayer Park sits in the heart of the Central Business District (CBD) and it is at the cross junction of three key busy roads â€“ Maxwell Road, Cecil Road and Telok Ayer Street. With many cosy nooks and swings interspersed within the park, the relaxing and intimate park setting allows visitors to sit comfortably under the shade of our majestic mature trees. 

The community and those working near the park are invited to share their thoughts on how this charming green space can be enhanced and made more inclusive for all.
