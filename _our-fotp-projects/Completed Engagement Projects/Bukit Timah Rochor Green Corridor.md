#### **A Journey Through A Riverine Forest**

Envisioned as a journey through a riverine forest, the Bukit Timah-Rochor Green Corridor will be a new linear park along the Bukit Timah Canal that will provide the public with more opportunities for leisure and recreation.

As part of the Friends of the Parks initiative, we invite the community to participate in the conceptualisation, design and management of Bukit Timah-Rochor Green Corridor. Read on to find out more about the plans for the park, and share your views with us, so that we can co-create parks with meaningful facilities to cater to the community’s needs.

#### **Recreational Connections**

The Bukit Timah-Rochor Green Corridor will form part of Singapore’s network of recreational connections that will be developed across the island. Altogether, the connections will enable Singaporeans to immerse themselves in greenery and provide more opportunities to explore our island and its green spaces.

Plans to extend the Green Corridor from Rifle Range Road to Kallang Riverside Park as part of the Coast-to-Coast Central Trail and Coast-to-Coast Southern Trail are being explored.

The existing Coast-to-Coast Central Trail currently runs at-grade along Bukit Timah Road and will cater to cyclists. The Green Corridor is envisioned to provide visitors with a botanical experience to bring them closer to nature, with the elevated sky park along the Green Corridor for pedestrians to enjoy.

#### **Timeline**
The first phase of the Bukit Timah-Rochor Green Corridor is approximately 1km long and consists of an elevated connection from the Rail Corridor to Jalan Kampong Chantek.  Visitors can continue their journey on the Coast-to-Coast (Central) Trail at-grade from Jalan Kampong Chantek. Construction of the first phase is estimated to complete by 2027.

Plans to extend the rest of the Green Corridor extending up to Kallang Riverside Park will be done up in phases, dovetailing with PUB’s future canal improvement works. (see fig. 1)

#### **Design Concept**

The Bukit Timah-Rochor Green Corridor will be a new linear park running along the Bukit Timah Canal that is envisioned as a journey through a riverine forest. It will be set amongst lush greenery, with the landscaping flanking the park recreating the natural setting of a tropical riverine forest in both species and structure.

The lush greenery will also provide shade, giving visitors a comfortable and unique walking experience. Trellises will be used to supplement shade provision in areas with space constraints too.

Animal totems with features such as bird nesting boxes may be installed along the Green Corridor. This will provide habitats for birds and other forms of wildlife and strengthens the Green Corridor’s function as an ecological corridor.

The corridor is envisioned to meander through the forested setting, to allow visitors to enjoy a leisurely stroll amid nature. Look-out points, shelters and seats will be located along the park to allow visitors to rest and enjoy the view.

The Green Corridor is likely to be elevated at some sections and at-grade at others, subject to further study. The first phase of the Green Corridor between the Rail Corridor and Jalan Kampong Chantek consists of an elevated sky park above the canal. It will connect to the Rail Corridor near the Bukit Timah Railway Station node, and the existing pedestrian overhead bridges across the roads. These areas will act as an access point for visitors on both sides of the canal.
