<p>NParks plans to introduce 4 themed trails spanning across the 13 southwestern
parks, increasing connectivity across the Southern Ridges. This includes
the Nature Discovery trail, Nature Play trail, Community trail, and Heritage

<p>NParks <strong>plans to enhance 13 southern parks</strong> as part of the
curation of themed trails to link them up, as well as plans to enhance
HortPark, Labrador Nature Park and West Coast Park into <strong>Destination Parks</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Destination Parks</strong> are large, regional parks with thematic
identities and unique feature to attract visitors from all over Singapore.
In 2012, Admiralty Park, East Coast Park and Lakeside Garden at Jurong
Lake Gardens (formerly known as Jurong Lake Park) were identified for development
into Destination Parks, which have since enjoyed high visitorship.</p>

<p>HortPark will be enhanced as an evolving <strong>gardening and lifestyle hub</strong> equipped
with spaces for various communities to come together and bond through shared
gardening and horticulture interests. In addition, HortPark will serve
as a demonstration site and horticultural showcase for the community to
learn about how gardening and horticulture can improve well-being.</p>

<p>The enhanced Labrador Nature Park will be a key node in the Labrador Nature
Park Network, with ecological corridors that will link to various biodiversity
sites within the network. To enrich visitors' experience of Labrador Nature
Park's uniquely intertwined <strong>natural and built heritage</strong>,
NParks will study the restoration of the former gun battery at Berlayer
Hill, one of the few remaining British military structures at Labrador
Nature Park.</p>
