<p><strong>Destination Parks</strong> are large, regional parks with thematic
identities and unique feature to attract visitors from all over Singapore.
In 2012, Admiralty Park, East Coast Park and Lakeside Garden at Jurong
Lake Gardens (formerly known as Jurong Lake Park) were identified for development
into Destination Parks, which have since enjoyed high visitorship.</p>

<p>HortPark will be enhanced as an evolving <strong>gardening and lifestyle hub</strong> equipped
with spaces for various communities to come together and bond through shared
gardening and horticulture interests. In addition, HortPark will serve
as a demonstration site and horticultural showcase for the community to
learn about how gardening and horticulture can improve well-being.</p>

<p>The enhanced Labrador Nature Park will be a key node in the Labrador Nature
Park Network, with ecological corridors that will link to various biodiversity
sites within the network. To enrich visitors' experience of Labrador Nature
Park's uniquely intertwined <strong>natural and built heritage</strong>,
NParks will study the restoration of the former gun battery at Berlayer
Hill, one of the few remaining British military structures at Labrador
Nature Park.</p>

<p>The enhanced West Coast Park will be positioned as the western gateway
to the Greater Southern Waterfront. Visitors can look forward to different
zones that provide a variety of active to passive family-centric experiences.</p>

on the plans to enhance the three planned Destination Parks, which will
