*Artist's impression of Tampines Boulevard Park*

Tampines Boulevard Park is situated in the Tampines North Region, adjacent to Sun Plaza Park and Tampines Eco Green. Flanked by the upcoming public residential areas, this park can interest stakeholders to visualise the space to be a vibrant community space for families and friends and bring Tampines residents closer.
