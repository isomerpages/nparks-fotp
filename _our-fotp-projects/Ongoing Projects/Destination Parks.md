In 2012, Admiralty Park, East Coast Park and Lakeside Garden at Jurong Lake Gardens (formerly known as Jurong Lake Park) were identified for development into Destination Parks, which have since enjoyed high visitorship.</p><h5>Proposed enhancements for planned Destination Parks</h5><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/hortpark%201.png"></div><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/hortpark%202.png"></div><p>HortPark will be enhanced as an evolving <strong>gardening and lifestyle hub</strong> equipped with spaces for various communities to come together and bond through shared gardening and horticulture interests.

To enrich visitors' experience of Labrador Nature Park's uniquely intertwined <strong>natural and built heritage</strong>, NParks will study the restoration of the former gun battery at Berlayer Hill, one of the few remaining British military structures at Labrador Nature Park.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/west%20coast%20park%201.png"></div><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/west%20coast%20park%202.png"></div><p>The enhanced West Coast Park will be positioned as the western gateway to the Greater Southern Waterfront.
